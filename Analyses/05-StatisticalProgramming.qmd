# Intro

This is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) file.
Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
This allows you to share your analyses and results with others so that they can see the results in line with the code for reproducibility.
Make sure to have only one sentence per line.
To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

# Preamble

## Install Libraries

```{r}

```

## Load Data

Load the data file that is in the following location: `./Data/player_stats_weekly.Rdata` (if running locally) or `../Data/player_stats_weekly.Rdata` (if rendering).

```{r}

```

## Download Data

Download the injuries data and load it into an object called `nfl_injuries`:

```{r}

```

# Characteristics of the Data

## Variable Names

Identify the variable names in the data file.

```{r}

```

## Data Structure

Examine the data structure.

```{r}
str(player_stats_weekly)
```

## Data Dimensions

Determine the dimensions (i.e., the number of rows and columns) of the data.

```{r}

```

## Number of Missing Elements

Determine how many missing (`NA`) elements there are in the data file.

```{r}
length(which(is.na(player_stats_weekly)))
```

## Number of Non-Missing Elements

Determine how many non-missing elements there are in the data file.

```{r}

```

## View the Data

```{r}

View(player_stats_weekly)
```

# Data Processing

## Subsetting

1. Create a new object, called `mydata`, that includes just Running Backs and Wide Receivers from seasons 2023 and 2024.
Keep just the following columns:

- `player_id`
- `display_name`
- `season`
- `week`
- `fantasyPoints`

```{r}

```

## Long to Wide

2. Create a new object, `mydata_wide`, that widens `mydata` by season and week.

```{r}
mydata_wide <- mydata %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from = c(season, week),
    names_prefix = "fantasyPoints_",
    values_from = fantasyPoints
  )
```

## Wide to Long

3. Create a new object, `mydata_long`, that lengthens the data by season and week.

```{r}
mydata_long <- mydata_wide %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("fantasyPoints_"),
    names_to = c("prefix", "season", "week"),
    names_sep = "_",
    values_to = "fantasyPoints"
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    season = as.integer(season),
    week = as.integer(week)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-prefix)
```

## Merging

Merge the `player_stats_weekly` object with the `nfl_injuries` object by player, season, and week.
The player's ID is labeled `player_id` in the `player_stats_weekly` object; it is labeled `gsis_id` in the `nfl_injuries` object.
Merge so that you only keep the records from `player_stats_weekly` object.

```{r}

```

# Session Info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
